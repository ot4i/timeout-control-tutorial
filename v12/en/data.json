The flow is started using a JSON input message over HTTP which is received by an HTTPInput node. The HTTPInput is wired to a Mapping node to construct a reply message which is returned using an HTTPReply. The HTTPInput node also drives a second branch in the message flow which uses a Compute node to configure Timeout request settings in the LocalEnvironment which control the TimeoutControl node. The TimeoutControl node introduces a delay of 30 seconds (this time period is based upon a field in the input message) before the TimeoutNotification node will fire and write some simple trace information to a file. The TimeoutControl node and the TimeoutNotification node (which are linked using an identifier property) work together to generate flow propagation events at particular times or at regular intervals. For simplicity, this scenario places the TimeoutControl and TimeoutNotification nodes in the same message flow, but they could be separated into different flows if the flows are deployed to the same integration server."
